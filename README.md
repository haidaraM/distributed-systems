# distributed-systems
My lab files for TDA596 Distributed Systems at Chalmers University of Technology during my first semester in 2016. 

You are free to use the code contained in repo.

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab was to develop a distributed blackboard over the network. During the lab, we have improved this
blackboard to make it more consistent, fault-torelant, efficient and reliable by implementing different algorithms.

To do this, we used the [Seattle Platform](https://seattle.poly.edu/html/), a platform that allows you to get access to computers around the world. The 
blackboard was then deployed on these computers. You can also use some virtual machines locally to test it. 

## Screenshots
Here are some screenshots of my latest version (lab3).
