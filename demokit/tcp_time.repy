  Start Date:
    3 May 2009
    Amended 5 July, 2009 to be an extension to time.repy

  Description:

    This module is an implementation of time_interface.repy

    Contacts a server running time_server.repy to get the current time from an
    NTP because only the server can communicate with an NTP.

    To use this module, make one call to time_updatetime() to get the
    time from the server.  This function also implicitly sets the time.  Then
    call time_gettime() every time the current time is needed.

# This function contacts the server to get the time from a NTP
def tcp_time_updatetime(localport):
  """
  <Purpose>
    Opens a connection with a server hosting time_server.repy, which obtains the
    current time via a NTP, then calls time_settime(float(currenttime)) to set
    the current time to the received value form the server.

  <Arguments>
    localport:

      The local port which may be used in contacting NTP servers.  It is
      currently not used in this function, but must be present as an argument
      for compatibility issues with time.repy.

  <Exceptions>
    Exception raised if advertise_lookup("time_server") fails after
    ten tries.

    Exception raised when a connection is not able to be established with any of
    the servers running time_server.repy.

  <Side Effects>
    time_settime(float(currenttime)) is called to set the time.

  <Returns>
    Returns the server ip:port that it managed to successfully connect to
